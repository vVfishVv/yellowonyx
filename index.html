  	mean that we don't at all exist because we must exist in some format even if it is false. Please make sure to 
  	come see us at our first show in the US!  We are a two person group. The lead vocalist is named Yellow and the 
  	master of the beats is Onyx. If you couldn't figure it out that is most definitively the way that we came up with
  	the name.</p>

  	<p class="body">We hail from Sweden. I would really love to tell you about how lovely the snow covered landscape is in
  	winter though, that town would even really exist right?! Let's just call it Landnotia. So, we grew up on a small hill
  	in Landnotia for our whole lives and then we ended up thinking that since we don't really exist whatsoever, why not not exist
  	in the United States. Since we are not existing in the US we decided that we'd not exist at a location with a much better
  	climate than Landnotia so we decided that we would totally not be in SC... So, here we aren't!</p>
